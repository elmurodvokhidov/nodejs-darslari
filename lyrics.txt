The Girl Is Mine

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover
You know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming
I don't believe it
The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine)




Thriller

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh, ooh
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh
They're out to get you
There's demons closin' in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
Chiller, thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh baby (thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night, babe (thriller night, babe), ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller




Beat It

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here"
"Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it, uh)
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)

Billie Jean

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover




Human Nature

Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why? Ho why?
(That way) Why? Ho why?
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Cha, da, cha, sha, sha, sha, sha, sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way
If they say why
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do my that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)

Baby Be Mine

I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side, ooh-ooh
Every moment takes me to paradise

There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)

The Girl Is Mine

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover
You know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming
I don't believe it
The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine)




Thriller

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh, ooh
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh
They're out to get you
There's demons closin' in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
Chiller, thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh baby (thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night, babe (thriller night, babe), ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller




Beat It

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here"
"Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it, uh)
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight

Billie Jean

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover




Human Nature

Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why? Ho why?
(That way) Why? Ho why?
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Cha, da, cha, sha, sha, sha, sha, sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way
If they say why
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do my that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)

Baby Be Mine

I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side, ooh-ooh
Every moment takes me to paradise
Darling, let me hold you
I'll warm you in my arms and melt your fears away
Show you all the magic that a perfect love can make
I need you night and day
So baby, be mine (Baby, you got to be mine)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time)
And we can share this ecstasy
As long as we believe in love
I won't give you reason to change your mind
(I can't sit still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
You are all the future that I desire
Girl, I need to hold you
Share my feelings in the heat of love's embrace
Show you all the passion burning in my heart today
It's never going to fade
So baby, be mine (Baby, you got to be mine)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time)
You're everything this world could be
The reason that I live, oh
Won't you stay with me until the morning sun
I promise you now that the dawn will be different
Lady can't you see that heaven's just begun
It's living here inside our hearts
There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
This will be a love lasting for all time
Girl, you got to hold me
We can touch the sky and light the darkest day
Hold me, only you and I can make sweet love this way
There's no more I can say
So baby, be mine (Baby be mine, baby you got to be mine)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give (Say you're thinking of me)

The Girl Is Mine

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover
You know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming
I don't believe it
The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine)




Thriller

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh, ooh
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh
They're out to get you
There's demons closin' in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
Chiller, thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh baby (thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night, babe (thriller night, babe), ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller




Beat It

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here"
"Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight

Just beat it (beat it, uh)
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated

Billie Jean

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover




Human Nature

Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why? Ho why?
(That way) Why? Ho why?
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Cha, da, cha, sha, sha, sha, sha, sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way
If they say why
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do my that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)

Baby Be Mine

I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side, ooh-ooh
Every moment takes me to paradise
Darling, let me hold you
I'll warm you in my arms and melt your fears away
Show you all the magic that a perfect love can make
I need you night and day
So baby, be mine (Baby, you got to be mine)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time)
And we can share this ecstasy
As long as we believe in love
I won't give you reason to change your mind
(I can't sit still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
You are all the future that I desire
Girl, I need to hold you
Share my feelings in the heat of love's embrace
Show you all the passion burning in my heart today
It's never going to fade
So baby, be mine (Baby, you got to be mine)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time)
You're everything this world could be
The reason that I live, oh
Won't you stay with me until the morning sun
I promise you now that the dawn will be different
Lady can't you see that heaven's just begun
It's living here inside our hearts
There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)

The Girl Is Mine

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover
You know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming
I don't believe it
The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine)




Thriller

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh, ooh
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh
They're out to get you
There's demons closin' in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
Chiller, thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh baby (thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night, babe (thriller night, babe), ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller




Beat It

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here"
"Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)

Billie Jean

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover




Human Nature

Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why? Ho why?
(That way) Why? Ho why?
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Cha, da, cha, sha, sha, sha, sha, sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way
If they say why
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do my that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)

The Girl Is Mine

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine

Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover
You know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming
I don't believe it
The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine)




Thriller

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh, ooh
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh
They're out to get you
There's demons closin' in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
Chiller, thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh baby (thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night, babe (thriller night, babe), ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller




Beat It

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here"
"Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

Billie Jean

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover




Human Nature

Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why? Ho why?
(That way) Why? Ho why?
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Cha, da, cha, sha, sha, sha, sha, sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way
If they say why
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do my that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)

The Girl Is Mine

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover
You know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming
I don't believe it
The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine)




Thriller

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh, ooh
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh
They're out to get you
There's demons closin' in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
Chiller, thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh baby (thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night, babe (thriller night, babe), ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller




Beat It

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here"
"Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it, uh)
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated

Billie Jean

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover




Human Nature

Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why? Ho why?
(That way) Why? Ho why?
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Cha, da, cha, sha, sha, sha, sha, sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way
If they say why
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do my that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)

The Girl Is Mine

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover
You know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming
I don't believe it
The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine)




Thriller

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh, ooh
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh
They're out to get you
There's demons closin' in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
Chiller, thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh baby (thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night, babe (thriller night, babe), ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller




Beat It

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here"

Billie Jean

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover




Human Nature

Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why? Ho why?
(That way) Why? Ho why?
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Cha, da, cha, sha, sha, sha, sha, sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way
If they say why
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do my that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)

Baby Be Mine

I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side, ooh-ooh
Every moment takes me to paradise

Show you all the magic that a perfect love can make
I need you night and day
So baby, be mine (Baby, you got to be mine)

So baby, be my girl (All the time)

(I can't sit still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)

It's living here inside our hearts
There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
This will be a love lasting for all time

We can touch the sky and light the darkest day

The Girl Is Mine

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover
You know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming
I don't believe it
The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine)




Thriller

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh, ooh
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh
They're out to get you
There's demons closin' in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
Chiller, thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh baby (thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night, babe (thriller night, babe), ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller




Beat It

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here"
"Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)

Just beat it (beat it)

Just beat it (beat it, uh)
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight

Billie Jean

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover




Human Nature

Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why? Ho why?
(That way) Why? Ho why?
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Cha, da, cha, sha, sha, sha, sha, sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way
If they say why
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do my that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)




P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)

You know you, you make me feel so good inside

Where did you come from, lady?
And, ooh, won't you take me there
Right away, won't you, baby?
Tenderoni, you've got to be
Spark my nature, sugar fly with me

We can make it right, hit the city lights
Then tonight, ease the loving pain
Let me take you to the max
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)

Got to get to you, baby
Won't you come, it's emergency
Cool my fire yearning
Honey, come set me free
Don't you know now is the perfect time?
We can dim the lights, just to make it right
In the night, hit the loving spot
I'll give you all that I've got
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)

The Lady in My Life

There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady, our love will shine (lighting the night)
Just put your trust in my heart
And meet me in paradise (now is the time)
Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away

Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams

And, baby, through the years
Gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
That you will always be the lady in my life
Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl
And I will keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night

And, baby, through the years
Even when we're old and gray
